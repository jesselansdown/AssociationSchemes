Decide on object types
	- Association Schemes
	- Coherent configurations
		- Homogeneous
		- Commutative
		- Symmetric (Association Scheme)

Add approximation of character table when it fails over the rationals.

Define = for association scheme objects
How to save association schemes and their properties to a file? Or to print?

Remove the Schurian AdjacencyMatrices code? It seems to be slower than the standard code...
Consider using CMat? BList ?

Break functions in to seperate files

Association scheme object
	- IsPPolynomial etc...
	- IsJohnsonScheme etc...
	- IsSchurian
	- group (if schurian)

Constructors
	- basic constructor from matrix
	- Johnson Scheme
	- Grassmann Scheme
	- Dual classical polar spaces
	- Fusion Scheme

Display method
	- Number of classes
	- P and Q matrices if known
	- Other attributes and properties if known and displayable

Basic functions
	- IsAssociationScheme
	- AdjacencyMatrices
	- IsGenerouslyTransitive
	- MinimalIdempotents
		- Fast method if IsSchurian and Q matrix known
	- CharacteristicVector

Other functions
	- GaussianCoefficients

<P/>
AssociationSchemes is a &GAP;<Cite Key="GAP4"/> package for working with association schemes and homogeneous coherent configurations. 
<P/>
For definitions and more information on the theory of association schemes and homogeneous coherent configurations, we refer you to <Cite Key="BannaiIto"/> and <Cite Key="Godsil"/>.
<P/>
It is important to note that the term "association scheme" is used differently by different authors. We reserve the term "association scheme" to mean a symmetric coherent configuration, and use "homogeneous coherent configuration" to refer to the more general objects.

<P/>
AssociationSchemes requires
<P/>
<List>
<Item>
&GAP; 4.8 (or later)
</Item>
</List>
<P/>
as well as the following &GAP; packages:
<P/>
<List>
<Item>
Digraphs 0.13.0 (or later)
</Item>
</List>
<P/>
You may of course use AssociationSchemes without the above packages, however the corresponding functionality will be unavailable. 
<P/>
You may also want the following packages:
<P/>
<List>
<Item>
NautyTracesInterface 0.2 (or later)
</Item>
</List>
<P/>
Note that NautyTracesInterface is not yet a deposited package. It can be obtained from the link in the appendix. It is not necessary, but it might improve speed of certain things such as finding the automorphism group, and checking isomorphisms.

<Heading>Installation</Heading>

<P/>
To install AssociationSchemes, simply copy to the "pkg" directory of your GAP installation and unzip.
<P/>
Alternatively, you may load the package from a location other than the &GAP; "pkg" directory by using the -L flag when opening &GAP;. Note that this requires the parent directory of AssociationSchemes to be called "pkg". See the &GAP; documentation for more details on how to do this. This is useful, for example, when administrative priveledges are required to access the &GAP; root directory.

  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YWelcome to AssociationSchemes[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YAssociationSchemes  is  a  [5XGAP[105X[GAP16]  package  for working with association
  schemes and homogeneous coherent configurations.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  definitions  and  more information on the theory of association schemes
  and homogeneous coherent configurations, we refer you to [BI84] and [God93].[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt  is  important  to  note  that  the  term  "association  scheme"  is used
  differently  by  different authors. We reserve the term "association scheme"
  to  mean  a  symmetric coherent configuration, and use "homogeneous coherent
  configuration" to refer to the more general objects.[133X

  [33X[0;0YIf you use AssociationSchemes in research leading to publication please cite
  it  as  you  would  a  paper. Example citations and a BibTeX entry are given
  below.  Please  check  that  the  version  and  DOI  match  the  version  of
  AssociationSchemes used in your research.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YPlease  also  inform  us by email of the paper, as we are very interested to
  hear how AssociationSchemes is being used![133X

  [33X[0;0YAssociationSchemes requires[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[5XGAP[105X 4.8 (or later)[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Yas well as the following [5XGAP[105X packages:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YDigraphs 0.13.0 (or later)[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YNautyTracesInterface 0.2 (or later)[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YYou may of course use AssociationSchemes without the above packages, however
  the corresponding functionality will be unavailable.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that  NautyTracesInterface  is  not yet a deposited package. It can be
  obtained from the link in the appendix.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.4 [33X[0;0YInstallation[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  install  AssociationSchemes,  simply copy to the "pkg" directory of your
  GAP installation and unzip.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAlternatively,  you  may load the package from a location other than the [5XGAP[105X
  "pkg"  directory  by  using  the  -L  flag  when opening [5XGAP[105X. Note that this
  requires  the parent directory of AssociationSchemes to be called "pkg". See
  the  [5XGAP[105X  documentation  for more details on how to do this. This is useful,
  for  example, when administrative priveledges are required to access the [5XGAP[105X
  root directory.[133X
